The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection model) is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different network protocols interact in a network. It's divided into seven layers, each representing a specific function in the transmission of data over a network. Here's a quick rundown of the layers from top to bottom:

1. **Application Layer**: This is where end-user applications and processes interact with the network. Examples include web browsers, email clients, etc.
2. **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for translating data into a format that the receiving system can understand. It deals with encryption, compression, and data representation.
3. **Session Layer**: This layer manages sessions or connections between applications. It ensures that communication is organized and can handle the start, maintenance, and termination of a session.
4. **Transport Layer**: This layer ensures reliable data transfer by controlling error detection and flow control. It manages how data is split into segments and ensures proper delivery (e.g., TCP, UDP).
5. **Network Layer**: This layer handles routing, addressing, and forwarding of data packets. It uses logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses) to determine the best path for the data to travel.
6. **Data Link Layer**: This layer deals with physical addressing (MAC addresses) and ensures reliable data transfer over a physical link. It handles error detection and correction at the link level.
7. **Physical Layer**: This layer deals with the transmission of raw data bits over a physical medium (like cables, switches, or wireless signals).

The OSI model helps to simplify network troubleshooting and the development of new network technologies by providing a clear, hierarchical structure for understanding how data flows through a network.
